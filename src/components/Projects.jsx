        <p>Hi! My name is Hanna Brender and I am from the Seattle, WA area. I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.gonzaga.edu/">Gonzaga University</a> in May 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <p>I have industry experience as a Java Developer and Android App Developer through my internship with <a href="https://www.boeing.com/">Boeing</a> and my contract work with <a href="https://gravityjack.com/">Gravity Jack</a>. In my free time I have taken courses on Web Development where I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB and Express.</p>
